First of all, you need to understand that Mexicans are proud of their culture, so you should show respect for their country. If you don\u2019t know anything about Mexico, then you should probably learn a few things before trying to insult someone from there. For example, did you know that Mexico is the most populous country in Latin America? The second most populous in the Americas? And one of the most influential countries in the world? If you don\u2019t know these things, then it\u2019s probably not a good idea to try to insult a Mexican.
